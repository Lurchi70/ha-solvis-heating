The `solvis_heating` integration uses the XML datainterface of the solvis remote extension of the heating system. 
This allows you to get details from your Solvis Heating device and integrate these into your Home Assistant installation.

Before being able to use the integration, you have to own a solvis remote device and have it attached, configured and available in your network. 
The xml-file is public and can be retrieved via http://<your-device-ip>/sc2_val.xml

When quering this interface your will retrieve a coded string like: 
<xml>
  <data>
    AA5555AA056B0C31350600120076028A013A018[...]0000000000
  </data>
</xml>
the returned payload data has a length of 439 Bytes in an undocumented format. This data will be decoded and depending on the configuration option 
made available. 
  
<div class='note warning'>
To retrieve the xml interface, a username and password must provided.
